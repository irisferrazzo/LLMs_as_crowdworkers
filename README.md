This repository accompanies the paper "Beyond Correlation: Why Likert-Scale Calibration Challenges LLM-as-Participant Designs".

It contains two Jupyter notebooks written in Python that are designed to exemplify the steps of the simulation pipeline discussed in the paper. One is used to simulate Barbosa and De Cat (2029) (*Barbosa_19.ipynb*), the other one is used to simulate Lakhzoum, Izaute, and Ferrand (2021) (*Lakhzoum_21.ipynb*). Both notebooks display the same structure, they only differ in data preprocessing and output evaluation. The proposed framework can be applied to research purposes. This repo includes the original experimental stimuli of the simulated studies (*630similarFrenchWordPair.csv* and *Barbosa&Cat_2019.csv*), with the replicated papers serving as its source.
